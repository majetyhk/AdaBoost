# calculate the alpha value using epsilon

# output: alpha value (single value) (from Line 12 in algorithm 5.7 from Textbook)

# input:
# weights: weights generated at the end of the previous iteration
# y_true: actual labels (ground truth)
# y_pred: predicted labels (from your newly generated decision stump)
# n_elements: number of elements in y_true or y_pred
# output:
# just the epsilon or error value (line 7 in algorithm 5.7 from Textbook)

# Calculate the weights using equation 5.69 from the textbook 
# Input:
# old_weights: weights from previous iteration
# alpha: current alpha value from Line 12 in algorithm 5.7 in the textbook
# y_true: actual class labels
# y_pred: predicted class labels
# n_elements: number of values in y_true or y_pred

# a vector of size n_elements containing updated weights

# implement myadaboost - simple adaboost classification
# use the 'rpart' method from 'rpart' package to create a decision stump 
# Think about what parameters you need to set in the rpart method so that it generates only a decision stump, not a decision tree
# Input: 
# train: training dataset (attributes + class label)
# k: number of iterations of adaboost
# n_elements: number of elements in 'train'
# Output:
# a vector of predicted values for 'train' after all the iterations of adaboost are completed
